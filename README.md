# hello-world
这是我的在hub上创建的第一个库
为了符合这里高端的逼格，下面的信息我就用英文写了
OK ，here is something useless but some thinkings.
Now I am working on my master degree,while I have to my a job at the moment,which bothers me a lot.
You know ,my degree is about ship designing ,howerver I don not like it anymore ,for it is to abstract and 
you can not make enough money to offer a house by the salary in the field. So I learn JAVA ee by my own ,which it
is not that easy ....
Anyway , I want to find a job in IT field now ,so I come here to learn something about the famous community,maybe a little 
helpful for my job-hunting.
